# Vehiclepool
A Web-App built to aim on saving the most important non-renewable energy source: Fuel. This is a submission to **Synergy'22** Hackathon under the theme **Energy**
conducted by GDSC and Student Energy Club at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Coimbatore.

## The solution
The solution that we have taken to approach this issue is to create a platform where people who are willing to perform car pooling find others who are willing to do so too and get the appropriate path for pooling. We have used Microsoft's Bing maps API to achieve the result of distance between two geological points and work with them.
Due to time constraints the solution does not feature the end result to work on the web-app but rather includes a python file named backend.py that does the job seperately with an assumed user's location and destination. Nevertheless, the project features a login and register page that takes us to a landing page for Vehicle Pooling and this is performed with a local database setup using XAMPP.
